### A1: Data Curation
### Goal:
We want to analyse the network traffic on English Wikipedia from December 2007 to August 2021.
### License:
The data for this project is obtained from [Wikimedia Foundation REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API#Terms_and_conditions).
This repository is licensed under the MIT license. The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
### Data:
This data was collected through 2 different APIs provided by the Wikimedia foundation (the legacy PageCounts API and PageViews API). This change between the APIs occured around May 2015 and we can see that in our timeseries representation of traffic with the dashed and normal graph lines. All values in the fields were primarily numerical (representing network traffic) and datetime.
